custom error pages
  ex. /^$%$ or something like that gave a malformed uri error

Layout changes:
  - auto-vote to 100% if you added a song
  - album art etc
  - top 3 songs listed
  - location of voting bars
  - song queue will continually grow even if there are 1000s of songs in it
  - colorscheme?
  - textbox (on / too) where you type in a room name and click enter and you go
  - button you click to jump to current playtime? (eg for if you got hit by a commercial and want to get back to the same play spot as the group)
